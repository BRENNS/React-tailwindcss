In this workshop, you will learn how to use Tailwind CSS by creating a login page.

# What is tailwind ?

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework, providing pre-defined classes for styling directly in HTML. Its flexibility and customization are facilitated through a configuration file, making it efficient for streamlined development, especially suited for smaller projects or individual developers.

# Initialize Project

- Create a React project with the TypeScript template:

```
npx create-react-app tailwind-workshop --template typescript
```

Start your project with:

```
npm start
```

# Step 1

We will start with a simple box with red background

- First of all you have to put a background color for your entire page.

- Now create a form with a height of 700px and a width of 500px with a white background color.

- You can center it by using the flex property.

# Step 2

Now we will add two inputs and one button

- One with an email placeholder

- Another one with a password placeholder and the password priority.

- A submit button

- You can also center it by using flex priority

# Step 3

Let's add effect to some component by adding

- a focus effect on the input

- a hover effect on the button

It will look better if you add a little transition effect to it.

# Step 4

Now let's see how to add animation

- Try to add a bounce animation to a component

# Step 5

Now make it prettier by:

Adding color, there are two ways to add color:

- First one add a custom color in your tailwind.config.js file

- Second one is the classic way directly in the code

Rounding the form, custom the input and button

# Conclusion

Congrats! You know now the basics of Tailwind.
